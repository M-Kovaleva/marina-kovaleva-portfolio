Welcome to my Portfolio! This project showcases the work I’ve done as a front-end development student in my first year. Here, you will find three of the projects I’ve built so far, demonstrating my growing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description
- Showcase of My Work: A collection of three different projects I've built as part of my learning journey.
- Responsive Design: My portfolio is designed to be fully responsive, meaning it looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.
- Project Details: For each project, you can explore the details, the technologies used, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
- Clean and Modern Layout: A minimalistic and clean design to highlight the projects and make navigation intuitive.

Projects Featured in My Portfolio:
1. Rainy Days - Online Shopping Website
Description: My first project, developed primarily on HTML and CSS. I created a website where customers can shop rain jackets.

2. Newton - Community Science Museum
Description: My second project as a front end developer, where I created a website for the local Community Science Museum using only HTML and CSS.

3. Modo - Online Shopping Website
Description: My year-end project exam: building a clean, modern e-commerce website using what I have learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so far.
